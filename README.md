# 🧠 WiDS Datathon 2025 – Multimodal Brain Imaging Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the Python implementation for the **WiDS (Women in Data Science) Datathon 2025** challenge.  
The goal of this project was to predict clinical or cognitive outcomes using **multimodal data**—including **quantitative features, categorical metadata, and brain functional connectome matrices**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and integrate multiple data modalities (quantitative, categorical, imaging).
- Handle missing values, scaling, and feature dimensionality reduction.
- Build and validate machine learning models to predict the target variable with high accuracy.
- Evaluate models using F1 score and Brier score metrics.
